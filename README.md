# Project: Snake-Game-Webapp-CMPE-131

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akumar23/SnakeGame.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akumar23/SnakeGame)

The web app is live right now at: https://snake-webapp.herokuapp.com/

Doc files can be found in the docs folder, under _build then _html then open index.html. It can only be opened after cloning the repo.

The tests are in the tests folder and can be run using the command python -m pytest 

The 12 features include:

Feature 1: Allowing users to register with a unique username

Feature 2: Allowing them to login with their registered credentials

Feature 3: Allowing them to logout from every page.

Feature 4: Giving users to the option to choose the color of the snake from a color picker page that has links to different versions of the snake game.

Feature 5: One of the options on the color pickers page lets users play a harder version of the game which places an extra dot on the screen that they have to avoid as they collect food.

Feature 6: The game itself

Feature 7: Playing music as the user plays the game

Feature 8: Saving the users score in a leaderboard and having that page be accessed from every page

Feature 9: Letting users click a 'replay game' link from the leaderboard page and sending them back to the color picker page to replay the game

Feature 10: Letting Admins access an adminpanel by going to https://snake-webapp.herokuapp.com/admin, clicking 'Enter Protected Area', and entering 'letmein' in the text box that pops up

Featyure 11: Once on the Admin page, there's a button that'll clear the database of all users in case of emergencies.

Features 12 and 13: We also worked on css to make the site have a uniform design and look clean. It was also used to shift text over and make some of it more visible as well as moving the gameboard more to the center and making the hard game mode fit better on smaller screens.
